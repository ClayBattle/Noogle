# Noogle
An extension that creates a new Google Doc and places it within my internal doc structure within 1 minute. Meant to be loaded as a dev extension. 

Spawned out of the need for 1. better google drive document organization and 2. frantic "oh no, I don't have any notes for this meeting" 1 minute before meetings.


### Extension Setup (Edge)
1. Click on the puzzle piece in Edge (extensions page)
2. Under installed extensions, click 'load unpacked'
3. Select this directory
4. Nice
