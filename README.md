# Noogle
An extension that creates a new Google Doc and places it within my internal doc structure within 1 minute. Meant to be loaded as a dev extension. 

Spawned out of the need for 1. better google drive document organization and 2. frantic "oh no, I don't have any notes for this meeting" 1 minute before meetings.


### Extension Setup (Edge)
1. Click on the puzzle piece in Edge (extensions page)
2. Under installed extensions, click 'load unpacked'
3. Select this directory
4. Nice

3. make sure the the oauth works
4. Test SAFELY creating a doc.
